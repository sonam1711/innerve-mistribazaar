# Nirmio

Nirmio is an India-first marketplace connecting households with workers/professionals and material suppliers—supporting in-app payments with an escrow-style release flow.

Key payment rules (v1):
- Supplier registration fee: ₹1600 (one-time)
- Services: customer uses a single "Pay & Complete" action; the booking is marked completed only after payment success (verified by webhook)
